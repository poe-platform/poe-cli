# Principles

- TDD is a MUST (only for code changes, not for configs)
- SOLID
- YAGNI, KISS
- Never copy/paste more than 5 lines of code
- Never revert code that you didn't create

# github workflows

Do not write unit tests
Use `npm run lint:workflows`

# Testing file changes

- Tests can't create files - use `memfs` library to test changes in memory
- Tests can't query LLM - implement abstraction to mock this reliably across all files

# Commits

- Commit every atomic change, once the tests are green.
- Follow Conventional Commits (`feat`, `fix`, `chore`, `docs`, `test`, `refactor`).
- Keep subjects imperative and under 72 characters.
- If the workspace is dirty, commit the old changes first so you can start clean
- Commit specific files that you edited, never blanket git add -A

# Configure commands

Regexes are not allowed. When modifying existing files, you must parse them and deep merge them. If you run into unsupported file e.g. yaml, install parser library.
