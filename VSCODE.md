   ```bash
   cd vscode-extension
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Compile the extension:
   ```bash
   npm run compile
   ```

   - Choose the generated `.vsix` file

## Usage

### Launching Poe Code

1. Open any file in VS Code
2. Click the terminal icon (üìü) in the top-right editor toolbar
3. A new terminal opens running `npx poe-setup interactive`
4. Start chatting with AI!

### First-time Setup

If you haven't configured your Poe API key yet:

```bash
npx poe-setup login --api-key YOUR_KEY
```

### Key Features in the Terminal

- **Chat with AI**: Type naturally to interact with AI models
- **File mentions**: Type `@` to open a file picker and select files to reference
- **Tool calling**: The AI can automatically read files, run commands, and more
- **MCP tools**: Add external tools with `/mcp add <name> <command>`
- **Model switching**: Change models with `/model GPT-5` or `/model Claude-Sonnet-4.5`
- **View tools**: See all available tools with `/tools`
- **Clear history**: Start fresh with `/clear`

### Example Workflow

```bash
# In the Poe Code terminal
> /model Claude-Sonnet-4.5
Switched to model: Claude-Sonnet-4.5

> @src/index.ts Can you explain what this file does?
‚è∫ ReadFile(src/index.ts) ‚éø Read 150 lines

Poe Code: This is the main entry point...

> /mcp add filesystem npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem /Users/gjones/DEV
MCP server 'filesystem' added and connected.

> /tools
Available tools:
- ReadFile: Read a file from the filesystem
