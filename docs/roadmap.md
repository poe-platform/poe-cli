# Roadmap

- [x] Standardize lifecycle wiring across filenames, variables, tests, docs
- [x] Model management in constants 
    - list: frontier models (used by opencode in the list)
    - string: default frontier model (used by opencode)
    - list: claude-code-only-models
    - string: default claude-code model - claude-sonnet-4.5
    - list: codex-only models
    - string: default codex model - gpt-5.1-contex
    - no other raw string mentions of models should exist
- [x] spawn --model <model> cli option, that would be passed through to the agent
    - Good: claude --model claude-sonnet-4-5
    - Good: codex --model o3
    - Wrong: opencode --model poe/claude-sonnet-4-5
    - [x] fix the opencode, it shoudld automatically prepend the model poe/ 
- [x] claude-code has this interactive selection, all configurations should support it, respect the default, but offer options. Based on the model management in constants
- [] configure should also support --model that would set the model as default
- [x] github issue resolver
    - [x] it does post some weird comment on the Issue Poe Code bot selected. Remove this comment
    - [x] agent shold get the whole conversation in issue, not just the title/description. Make this a script that will format it
    - [x] add tags model:<model> so the model can be overwritten and passed to agent, optional
- [x] Move the health check to separate command `test` poe-code test claude-code
    - remove the concept of lifecycle interceptors altogether
    - don't overengineer
